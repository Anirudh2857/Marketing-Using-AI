Artifical Intellligence can be used in marketing to predict which product needs to be marketed in which country. With the help of K-means clustering algorithm, Auto -Encoders and Principal componenet Analysis this can be made possible. The code present in the ipynb file conistes of all the 2D and 3D graphs. We remove the columns which will not be required for the computation and then applying K-means and auto-encoders to find the optimal number of clusters that is required.
